Goals of *swyft*
================

We developed SWYFT to help solving our own data analysis problems from various
fields of astroparticle physics, with the following goals in mind.

- SWYFT enables neural network based inference with the convenience of
  traditional sampling tools.
- SWYFT is as precise as likelihood-based methods where those can be applied,
  and flexible enough to cover the wide range of scenarios where they fail.
- SWYFT is simulator efficient, and automatically re-uses previous simulator
  runs in new analyses.


Plans
-----

- SWYFT should provide black-box solutions to a wide range of analysis
  problems, with a single accuracy parameter.

- SWYFT is expected to be in particular useful in the context of very expensive
  and slow simulators.  
- SWYFT is efficient initially and enables hyper-efficient follow up
  studies.

.. note::
   We are currently developing SWYFT towards a full-fledged reliable inference
   tool, together with engineers the Dutch eScience center and SURFsara, as
   part of the eTEC-BIG grant “Dark Generators”. Any feedback will be useful to
   shape the development of this tool. Stay tuned!
