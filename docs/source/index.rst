Welcome to swyft's documentation!
========================================

SWYFT is a flexible and powerful tool for simulator efficient neural marginal posterior estimation.  It is meant as a drop-in replacement for conventional sampling based tools.  Although it is a likelihood-free tool, it reproduces results of likelihood-based analyses to high accuracy, usually with orders of magnitude less simulator runs.
