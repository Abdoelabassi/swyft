   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to swyft's documentation!
=================================

**Disclaimer: SWYFT is research software under heavy development in late alpha
stage. We do use it in production for research papers, but it should be handled
with care. If you encounter problems, please contact the authors or submit a
bug report as a github issue. Pull requests are welcome.**

*Cursed by the dimensionality of your nuisance space? Wasted by Markov
chains that reject your simulations? Exhausted from messing with
simplistic models, because your inference algorithm cannot handle the
truth? Try SWYFT for some pain relief.*
